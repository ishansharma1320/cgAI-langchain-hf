Further details on chat history management is covered here.We will cover two approaches:Chains, in which we always execute a retrieval step;Agents, in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).For the external knowledge source, we will use the same LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng from the RAG tutorial.Setup\\u200bDependencies\\u200bWe\\'ll use OpenAI embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any Embeddings, and VectorStore or Retriever. We\\'ll use the following packages:%%capture --no-stderr%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-chroma beautifulsoup4We need to set environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY, which can be done directly or loaded from a .env file like so:import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):    os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()# import dotenv# dotenv.load_dotenv()LangSmith\\u200bMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"if not os.environ.get(\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"):    os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()Chains\\u200bLet\\'s first revisit the Q&A app we built over the LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng in the RAG tutorial.OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleCohereNVIDIAFireworksAIGroqMistralAITogetherAIpip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")pip install -qU langchain-anthropicimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAIllm = AzureChatOpenAI(    azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"],    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],)pip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAIllm = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\")pip install -qU langchain-cohereimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoherellm = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r-plus\")pip install -qU langchain-nvidia-ai-endpointsimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"NVIDIA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain import ChatNVIDIAllm = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-fireworksimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksllm = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")pip install -qU langchain-mistralaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAIllm = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)import bs4from langchain import hubfrom langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chainfrom langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chainfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter# 1.

This process helps in guiding the agent through the various subgoals required to achieve the overall task efficiently. Different techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts can be used to decompose tasks into step-by-step processes, enhancing performance and understanding of the model\\'s thinking process.\"Note that we have used the built-in chain constructors create_stuff_documents_chain and create_retrieval_chain, so that the basic ingredients to our solution are:retriever;prompt;LLM.This will simplify the process of incorporating chat history.Adding chat history\\u200bThe chain we have built uses the input query directly to retrieve relevant context. But in a conversational setting, the user query might require conversational context to be understood. For example, consider this exchange:Human: \"What is Task Decomposition?\"AI: \"Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable for an agent or model.\"Human: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"In order to answer the second question, our system needs to understand that \"it\" refers to \"Task Decomposition.\"We\\'ll need to update two things about our existing app:Prompt: Update our prompt to support historical messages as an input.Contextualizing questions: Add a sub-chain that takes the latest user question and reformulates it in the context of the chat history. This can be thought of simply as building a new \"history aware\" retriever. Whereas before we had:query -> retrieverNow we will have:(query, conversation history) -> LLM -> rephrased query -> retrieverContextualizing the question\\u200bFirst we\\'ll need to define a sub-chain that takes historical messages and the latest user question, and reformulates the question if it makes reference to any information in the historical information.We\\'ll use a prompt that includes a MessagesPlaceholder variable under the name \"chat_history\". This allows us to pass in a list of Messages to the prompt using the \"chat_history\" input key, and these messages will be inserted after the system message and before the human message containing the latest question.Note that we leverage a helper function create_history_aware_retriever for this step, which manages the case where chat_history is empty, and otherwise applies prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() | retriever in sequence.create_history_aware_retriever constructs a chain that accepts keys input and chat_history as input, and has the same output schema as a retriever.from langchain.chains import create_history_aware_retrieverfrom langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholdercontextualize_q_system_prompt = (    \"Given a chat history and the latest user question \"    \"which might reference context in the chat history, \"    \"formulate a standalone question which can be understood \"    \"without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \"    \"just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.\")contextualize_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (\"system\", contextualize_q_system_prompt),        MessagesPlaceholder(\"chat_history\"),        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),    ])history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(    llm, retriever, contextualize_q_prompt)API Reference:create_history_aware_retriever | MessagesPlaceholderThis chain prepends a rephrasing of the input query to our retriever, so that the retrieval incorporates the context of the conversation.Now we can build our full QA chain. This is as simple as updating the retriever to be our new history_aware_retriever.Again, we will use create_stuff_documents_chain to generate a question_answer_chain, with input keys context, chat_history, and input-- it accepts the retrieved context alongside the conversation history and query to generate an answer. A more detailed explaination is over hereWe build our final rag_chain with create_retrieval_chain. This chain applies the history_aware_retriever and question_answer_chain in sequence, retaining intermediate outputs such as the retrieved context for convenience. It has input keys input and chat_history, and includes input, chat_history, context, and answer in its output.from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chainfrom langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chainqa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (\"system\", system_prompt),        MessagesPlaceholder(\"chat_history\"),        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),    ])question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)API Reference:create_retrieval_chain | create_stuff_documents_chainLet\\'s try this. Below we ask a question and a follow-up question that requires contextualization to return a sensible response. Because our chain includes a \"chat_history\" input, the caller needs to manage the chat history. We can achieve this by appending input and output messages to a list:from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessagechat_history = []question = \"What is Task Decomposition?\"ai_msg_1 = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": question, \"chat_history\": chat_history})chat_history.extend(    [        HumanMessage(content=question),        AIMessage(content=ai_msg_1[\"answer\"]),    ])second_question = \"What are common ways of doing it?\"ai_msg_2 = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": second_question, \"chat_history\": chat_history})print(ai_msg_2[\"answer\"])API Reference:AIMessage | HumanMessageTask decomposition can be achieved through various methods such as using techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts to break down complex tasks into smaller steps. Common ways include prompting the model with simple instructions like \"Steps for XYZ\" or task-specific instructions like \"Write a story outline.\" Human inputs can also be used to guide the task decomposition process effectively.tipCheck out the LangSmith trace Stateful management of chat history\\u200bHere we\\'ve gone over how to add application logic for incorporating historical outputs, but we\\'re still manually updating the chat history and inserting it into each input. In a real Q&A application we\\'ll want some way of persisting chat history and some way of automatically inserting and updating it.For this we can use:BaseChatMessageHistory: Store chat history.RunnableWithMessageHistory: Wrapper for an LCEL chain and a BaseChatMessageHistory that handles injecting chat history into inputs and updating it after each invocation.For a detailed walkthrough of how to use these classes together to create a stateful conversational chain, head to the How to add message history (memory) LCEL page.Below, we implement a simple example of the second option, in which chat histories are stored in a simple dict. LangChain manages memory integrations with Redis and other technologies to provide for more robust persistence.Instances of RunnableWithMessageHistory manage the chat history for you. They accept a config with a key (\"session_id\" by default) that specifies what conversation history to fetch and prepend to the input, and append the output to the same conversation history. Below is an example:from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistorystore = {}def get_session_history(session_id: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:    if session_id not in store:        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()    return store[session_id]conversational_rag_chain = RunnableWithMessageHistory(    rag_chain,    get_session_history,    input_messages_key=\"input\",    history_messages_key=\"chat_history\",    output_messages_key=\"answer\",)API Reference:ChatMessageHistory | BaseChatMessageHistory | RunnableWithMessageHistoryconversational_rag_chain.invoke(    {\"input\": \"What is Task Decomposition?\"},    config={        \"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"abc123\"}    },  # constructs a key \"abc123\" in `store`.)[\"answer\"]\\'Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable.

Using agents allow you to offload some discretion over the retrieval process. Although their behavior is less predictable than chains, they offer some advantages in this context:Agents generate the input to the retriever directly, without necessarily needing us to explicitly build in contextualization, as we did above;Agents can execute multiple retrieval steps in service of a query, or refrain from executing a retrieval step altogether (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from a user).Retrieval tool\\u200bAgents can access \"tools\" and manage their execution. In this case, we will convert our retriever into a LangChain tool to be wielded by the agent:from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tooltool = create_retriever_tool(    retriever,    \"blog_post_retriever\",    \"Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.\",)tools = [tool]API Reference:create_retriever_toolTools are LangChain Runnables, and implement the usual interface:tool.invoke(\"task decomposition\")\\'Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

Task decomposition can be facilitated by using simple prompts, task-specific instructions, or human inputs.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 119, 'prompt_tokens': 636, 'total_tokens': 755}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-4a701854-97f2-4ec2-b6e1-73410911fa72-0')]}}----LangGraph comes with built in\"),\n",
